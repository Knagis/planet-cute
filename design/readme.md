The PlanetCute.design file is the original source retrieved from
[Lost Garden blog][source].

To open it, Expression Design 4 is needed, however the download is no longer provided
by Microsoft, one potential source is [Malavida][app].

Expression Design allows to export as SVG by copying (the export menu does not provide
such option). Go to Edit - Options and change the Clipboard XAML format to SVG and then
use Edit - Copy as XAML option.
